❌ WHAT'S LACKING (Critical Gaps)
Based on 2025 executive dashboard best practices:

Real-Time Data Pipeline - No live data ingestion, WebSocket updates, or auto-refresh
Automated Alerts System - No notifications for KPIs outside target ranges
Predictive Analytics - No forecasting, trend analysis, or AI-powered insights
Drill-Down Navigation - Can't click metrics to see underlying details
Command Actions - No approval workflows, fund transfers, or escalation buttons
AI Insights Panel - No anomaly detection or automated recommendations
Export Capabilities - No PDF/CSV export for offline sharing
Goal Progress Tracking - No company-wide goal with progress bar at top
Accessibility - Missing WCAG color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
🚀 WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED (Prioritized Roadmap)
TIER 1: Foundation (High Impact)
Feature	Description	Best Practice Source
Global KPI Header	5-7 key metrics at top (Revenue, Margin, Cash, Churn, Goal Progress)	"Executives spend 47 seconds evaluating dashboards"
Last Updated Timestamp	Prominent display of data freshness	Industry standard
Loading/Error States	Skeleton loaders and error boundaries for all data	UX best practice
Component Modularization	Break ExecPortal.tsx into feature modules	Performance requirement
TIER 2: Interactivity (Medium Impact)
Feature	Description
Drill-Down Navigation	Click any metric to see breakdown by region/product/time
Time Range Selector	Global filter for 7d/30d/90d/YTD across all charts
Auto-Refresh Toggle	Button to enable real-time updates
Quick Actions Bar	Approve budget, escalate issue, schedule review
TIER 3: Intelligence (Differentiator)
Feature	Description
AI Insights Panel	"Revenue dip in Q4 tied to renewal cycles" annotations
Predictive Forecasts	Revenue/churn projections with confidence bands
Anomaly Alerts	Automated notifications for unusual patterns
Recommendation Engine	"Consider increasing marketing spend in EMEA"
TIER 4: Polish (Best-in-Class)
Feature	Description
Mobile-Responsive Design	Touch targets 56x56px, simplified mobile view
Export to PDF/CSV	One-click reports for board meetings
Accessibility Audit	WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
Performance Optimization	<3 second load time, lazy loading
📋 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN
Would you like me to implement these improvements? I can start with the highest-impact items:

Add Global KPI Header with the 5 most critical metrics and last-updated timestamp
Add Loading States and skeleton loaders for all data sections
Add Drill-Down Modals so clicking metrics shows detailed breakdowns
Add AI Insights Panel with automated annotations on charts
Add Export Button for PDF/CSV reports
Modularize the codebase to fix the 500KB file issue
