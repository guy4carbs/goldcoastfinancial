Create me a perfect Replit Design Agent prompt to create an incredible website for Gold Coast Financial, a life insurance agency. Utilize X to find the best and most helpful tips and tricks to achieve a best-in-class brag-worthy site. Consider all of the greatest sites that have been made with it—I believe it uses Gemini for the Design Agent—and tailor the prompt to give it the greatest success possible.
Use Design Mode with Gemini 3 to create a premium, secure, functional "Executive Command Dashboard" portal (also called Exec Portal) for Gold Coast Financial, an independent life insurance agency in Naperville, Illinois. This is the Executive Command Dashboard. Who Uses It: * CEO * Executives. Core Purpose: * Strategic decisions * Capital oversight. Link to this portal from the main site's footer quick links (e.g., "Executive Dashboard Login"). Require a login for executives only—implement a simple demo login for now (username: exec@demo.com, password: goldcoastexec2026) with basic authentication (store in local storage or mock DB if possible, no real backend yet). After login, redirect to the dashboard. Match the main site's branding: Logo (attach if available) with gold (#D4AF37), darker red (#8B0000), black (#000000); elegant typography (serif headings like Playfair Display, sans-serif body like Inter); subtle animations (fade-ins, hovers); light mode (white/light gray backgrounds) and dark mode (black/dark gray) toggle (sun/moon icon in header). Fully responsive, SEO-optimized where applicable (though internal), with premium design avoiding AI slop—aim for sophisticated, trustworthy interfaces like top financial executive dashboards (e.g., Salesforce Einstein Analytics or Tableau-inspired executive views, but customized for insurance agency strategy).
Build incrementally in planning mode first (ideate structure, tech stack, PRD outline), then switch to build mode at medium autonomy (strict but intuitive) for core build, high autonomy for enhancements like animations, charts, and interactive features. Use section-by-section validation: Generate one major section at a time (e.g., login first, then dashboard, then each nav page), allow refinement before proceeding. Provide real functionality (e.g., interactive charts via Chart.js, tables with mock data, alert systems, forms for capital allocation), responsive design (desktop full analysis, mobile alerts/summary only), edge cases (e.g., no data states like "No alerts today", loading spinners, error handling for invalid inputs), and premium visuals (ample white space, high contrast accessibility, subtle gradients/shadows in gold/red). Reference great Replit sites like advanced dashboards or agency tools for inspiration—focus on clean, conversion-focused (strategic decision-making) layouts with depth. Use ShadCN or Tailwind for consistency, Iconify for icons (e.g., Solar set). Define output file types (HTML/CSS/JS), UI layouts/sections explicitly, integrations (mock APIs/JSON for data), logic paths (e.g., if threshold breached, show red alert), edge cases/error handling, mobile responsive, and premium design throughout. Start with a PRD-like outline based on this spec, then build.
Navigation Structure: * Revenue * Forecasts * Risk * Leadership (implement as sidebar or top nav post-login, with logout button).
Systems Embedded (BUILD SPECIFICATION) (build functional mocks with mock data; use local storage/JSON for persistence if possible—no external DB yet):

Executive Dashboard (1): Revenue, cash, agent count (overview with key metrics cards, trends/charts).
Capital & Financial Operations (2): Cash flow (charts/tables), Burn/runway (calculations like months of runway based on mock burn rates).
Predictive Analytics & BI (5): Forecasts (line charts for revenue projections), Risk flags (alert banners).
Strategic Partnerships (4): Partner ROI (tables with mock ROI calculations for top carriers).
Leadership Succession (8): Bench strength (visuals like org charts or strength meters for team readiness).

What Executives See: * Revenue * Cash * Forecasts (display in relevant sections, aggregated enterprise-wide).
What Executives Can Do: * Allocate capital * Adjust strategy (implement interactive forms/buttons, e.g., sliders for marketing spend allocation that update mock forecasts in real-time).
What Executives Cannot Do: * Execute ops * Coach agents (enforce via disabled features or role-based hiding).
Backend / Build Requirements: * Read-heavy analytics layer * Trusted data pipelines (frontend-focused: mock JSON data pipelines with validation; use console.log/local storage for logging).
AI Integration (Future Work): * Scenario modeling * Strategic risk alerts (include placeholders or mock buttons for these, e.g., "Run AI Scenario" that generates sample outputs).
Inputs / Outputs Inputs: * Aggregated enterprise data Outputs: * Strategic directives (handle via form submissions/updates: e.g., allocation input → update directives display; generate mock outputs like alerts or reports).
Additional Function: Implement an "Access Control" section (under Leadership or as a dedicated tab) where executives appoint where what type of email goes where. For example, if an admin creates a new agent's email and puts it through the admin portal (will be made in the future), the exec board then can see where the emails are and the things they can access. We are in full control as to where they are allowed to access and what they cant. We also have the ability to add an email into the system and control what it can access. Build this as an interactive table/form: List of emails (mock data), checkboxes/dropdowns for access levels (e.g., Agent Lounge access: Yes/No; View Earnings: Read-Only/None), buttons to add new email (form: email, role, permissions), and save changes (update local storage mock DB). Include visibility into pending emails from admin portal (mock queue).
Decisions It Enables: * Capital allocation (marketing spend, hiring, incentives) * Override and compensation management * Intervention in agent churn or inactivity * Cash flow protection * Growth pacing and scaling decisions (integrate into interactive elements, e.g., buttons/forms that simulate these decisions and show mock impacts on charts).
What Failure Looks Like If this system is inaccurate, delayed, or untrusted: * Financial exposure increases * Overrides may exceed liquidity * Growth decisions become speculative * Leadership reverts to anecdotal management Failure here does not cause inconvenience — it creates existential risk. (Incorporate as disclaimers/tooltips in UI to emphasize reliability; mock data must be accurate in simulations).
BUSINESS OBJECTIVES & SUCCESS CRITERIA Primary Business Problems Solved: * Lack of real-time financial clarity * Delayed awareness of agent inactivity or churn * Poor visibility into override exposure * Cash flow surprises * Reactive instead of proactive leadership behavior. Core Objectives: 1. Reduce executive decision latency to <10 seconds 2. Maintain real-time visibility into cash and obligations 3. Detect operational decay before revenue impact 4. Enable confident scaling without guesswork. Success Criteria (Quantifiable): * ≥99.5% financial reconciliation accuracy monthly * <24-hour lag on all financial metrics * Active agent ratio monitored daily * Zero override payout surprises * Executive reliance on dashboard over manual reports. (Display these as a "Success Metrics" widget with mock progress bars/checks; ensure UI supports low latency with fast-loading mocks).
METRIC DEFINITIONS (EXTREMELY PRECISE) 1. Total Revenue Formal Definition Total premium revenue issued by carriers within a defined period, separated by booking and collection status. Data Sources * Carrier commission statements * CRM policy records * Accounting system Calculation Logic * Gross Booked Revenue = Sum(issued policy premiums) * Collected Revenue = Sum(carrier-paid premiums) * Net Revenue = Collected − chargebacks − refunds Exclusions * Pending applications * Declined policies * Unfunded drafts Update Frequency * Booked: Daily * Collected: Daily batch * Net: Daily batch Data Owner * Finance / Accounting Failure Modes Double-counting issued policies Prevention: Unique policy ID enforcement (Implement as a detailed revenue page with charts/tables following this exact logic; use mock data to simulate calculations, e.g., JSON with policy IDs to prevent doubles; include tooltips with definitions).
DATA SOURCES & PIPELINES Internal Systems * CRM (agents, production, recruiting) * Commission systems * Banking * Accounting * Licensing & contracting ETL vs ELT Decision ELT chosen * Raw data preserved for audit * Flexibility in metric evolution * Lower transformation risk Data Validation Rules * Schema validation * Range checks * Referential integrity enforcement Error Handling * Failed loads quarantined * Alerts sent to data owner * No silent data drops (Mock these in code: Use JSON loaders with validation functions; simulate errors with alerts).
DASHBOARD UX / UI LOGIC Layout Philosophy Top-down hierarchy: 1. Cash & Revenue 2. Overrides 3. Agent Health 4. Growth 5. Alerts Cognitive Load Rules * ≤7 primary visual elements * Default to trends over tables * Drill-down only when requested Color Logic * Green: Normal * Yellow: Watch * Red: Action required Mobile vs Desktop * Desktop: Full analysis * Mobile: Alerts + summary only (Strictly follow this: Dashboard layout starts with cash/revenue cards, then overrides, etc.; limit visuals per section; use color-coded elements; responsive breakpoints for mobile summaries).
OPERATIONAL ALERTS SYSTEM Trigger Logic * Threshold-based * Trend-based * Comparative variance Severity Levels * Informational * Warning * Critical Delivery * Slack (primary) * Email (secondary) * SMS (critical only) False-Positive Prevention * Multi-period confirmation * Manual acknowledgment requirement (Build interactive alerts: Banners/pop-ups with colors/severities; mock triggers (e.g., if revenue < threshold, red critical); acknowledgment buttons that dismiss/update local storage; simulate deliveries via console logs).
GOVERNANCE & ACCOUNTABILITY Ownership * Finance: Financial metrics * Ops: Agent activity * Data team: Pipeline integrity Review Cadence * Daily automated checks * Weekly executive review * Monthly reconciliation Change Management * Versioned metric definitions * Executive approval required * Backward compatibility enforced (Include a "Governance" section with these details as read-only text/tables; mock checks with timers).
SCALING STRATEGY Agent Growth * Indexed queries * Partitioned data tables Revenue Scale * Pre-aggregated metrics * Asynchronous processing Future Expansion * Predictive alerts * Forecasting models * Multi-entity support (Prepare code for scale: Use efficient mocks; placeholders for future features).
RISK ANALYSIS Technical Risks * API outages Mitigation: Cached fallbacks Data Integrity Risks * Carrier delays Mitigation: Accrual vs realized separation Operational Risks * Misinterpretation Mitigation: Usage playbooks Human Error Manual overrides Mitigation: Restricted permissions (Incorporate as a "Risks" widget with mitigations; implement fallbacks in mocks, e.g., cached data if "API" fails).
Core users: Executives (full access for demo).
Login Page: Clean form (email/password, "Login" button in gold). Error handling (invalid creds alert). Post-login, persist session (mock token).
Overall Best Practices: Build section-by-section: Hero/login first, then dashboard, then each nav page. Use screenshots/references if attached for layout (e.g., attach dashboard inspo). Define logic: If threshold breached, trigger alert; if allocation changed, update forecasts. Edge cases: Empty states ("No risks detected"), loading spinners, mobile responsive. Integrations: Mock APIs (JSON placeholders for data). Animations: Subtle (e.g., chart fade-in). Trust/Security: Badges (e.g., "Secure Exec Dashboard"), disclaimers. Light/dark toggle persists across pages. Generate full app now—start in planning mode, propose plan, then build. I'll refine section-by-section.
