EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD SYSTEM
Mission-Critical Design, Implementation, and Governance Document

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
What the System Is
The Executive Dashboard is a centralized, real-time decision control system that consolidates financial, operational, and organizational data into a single, authoritative interface for ownership and executive leadership.
It is not a reporting tool, BI experiment, or visual convenience.
It is an operational control surface for a high-growth business.

Why It Exists
As revenue, agents, and complexity scale, verbal updates, spreadsheets, and delayed reports introduce:
Decision latency
Financial blind spots
Misallocation of capital
Undetected operational decay
This system exists to eliminate uncertainty at the executive level and allow leadership to act faster than problems can compound.

Who Uses It
Ownership
CEO / COO / CFO-level executives
Select senior operators with financial authority
This dashboard is not designed for agents, frontline managers, or analysts.

Decisions It Enables
Capital allocation (marketing spend, hiring, incentives)
Override and compensation management
Intervention in agent churn or inactivity
Cash flow protection
Growth pacing and scaling decisions

What Failure Looks Like
If this system is inaccurate, delayed, or untrusted:
Financial exposure increases
Overrides may exceed liquidity
Growth decisions become speculative
Leadership reverts to anecdotal management
Failure here does not cause inconvenience — it creates existential risk.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES & SUCCESS CRITERIA
Primary Business Problems Solved
Lack of real-time financial clarity
Delayed awareness of agent inactivity or churn
Poor visibility into override exposure
Cash flow surprises
Reactive instead of proactive leadership behavior

Core Objectives
Reduce executive decision latency to <10 seconds
Maintain real-time visibility into cash and obligations
Detect operational decay before revenue impact
Enable confident scaling without guesswork

Success Criteria (Quantifiable)
≥99.5% financial reconciliation accuracy monthly
<24-hour lag on all financial metrics
Active agent ratio monitored daily
Zero override payout surprises
Executive reliance on dashboard over manual reports

METRIC DEFINITIONS (EXTREMELY PRECISE)
1. Total Revenue
Formal Definition
Total premium revenue issued by carriers within a defined period, separated by booking and collection status.
Data Sources
Carrier commission statements
CRM policy records
Accounting system
Calculation Logic
Gross Booked Revenue = Sum(issued policy premiums)
Collected Revenue = Sum(carrier-paid premiums)
Net Revenue = Collected − chargebacks − refunds
Exclusions
Pending applications
Declined policies
Unfunded drafts
Update Frequency
Booked: Daily
Collected: Daily batch
Net: Daily batch
Data Owner
Finance / Accounting
Failure Modes
Double-counting issued policies
Prevention: Unique policy ID enforcement

2. Overrides
Formal Definition
Commission income earned from downstream production based on predefined hierarchical percentages.
Data Sources
Org hierarchy table
Commission schedules
Carrier payout files
Calculation Logic
Override = Σ (Downline Production × Override %)
Update Frequency
Accrued: Daily
Realized: Weekly / per carrier
Data Owner
Finance
Failure Modes
Hierarchy mismatch
Prevention: Immutable hierarchy snapshots per period

3. Agent Count
Formal Definition
All individuals with an active license and at least one active carrier contract.
Data Sources
Licensing system
Contracting system
CRM
Update Frequency
Daily
Failure Modes
Counting inactive or terminated agents
Prevention: Status-based inclusion rules

4. Active vs Inactive Agents
Definitions
Active: ≥1 issued policy in last 14 days
Semi-Active: No policy in 14–30 days
Inactive: No policy >30 days
Data Source
CRM policy issuance data
Update Frequency
Daily rolling window

5. Cash Position
Formal Definition
Liquid funds available for operations after known obligations.
Data Sources
Bank APIs
Accounting system
Commission obligations ledger
Calculation
Cash = Bank Balances − Pending Obligations
Update Frequency
Daily (intra-day optional)

6. Growth Rate
Definitions
MoM, QoQ, YoY growth for revenue and active agents
Formula
(Current − Prior) ÷ Prior
Smoothing
7-day rolling averages for daily views

7. Operational Alerts
Definition
Automated notifications triggered by metric deviation beyond defined thresholds.
Examples
Cash below X weeks of obligations
Active agent ratio below threshold
Revenue variance outside historical band

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (CRITICAL)
PLANNING
☐ Finalize metric definitions
Why: Prevents rework
Owner: Exec + Finance
Done: Signed spec

BUILD
☐ Connect data sources
☐ Build raw data tables
☐ Implement transformations
☐ Create metric logic
Done: Data reconciles with accounting

TESTING
☐ Back-test historical data
☐ Validate alert triggers
☐ Stress test volumes
Done: No unexplained variance

DEPLOYMENT
☐ Secure access roles
☐ Launch dashboard
☐ Enable alerts
Done: Executives using system

VALIDATION
☐ Weekly reconciliation
☐ Executive sign-off
Done: Dashboard replaces manual reports

ONGOING MAINTENANCE
☐ Monitor pipelines
☐ Review thresholds quarterly
☐ Audit annually

FINAL NOTE
This system is intentionally overbuilt because:
Trust is binary
Financial systems either work or kill companies
Speed without accuracy is worse than slowness
