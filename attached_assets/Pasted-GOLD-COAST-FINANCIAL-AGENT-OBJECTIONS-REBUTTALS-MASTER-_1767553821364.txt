GOLD COAST FINANCIAL
AGENT OBJECTIONS & REBUTTALS MASTER PLAYBOOK
(Internal Training Only)

HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT Objections are NOT rejection


Objections mean the client is still engaged


Your job is to acknowledge → reassure → redirect


Do not argue


Slow your voice down


Use these verbatim until you’re experienced



CALL FLOW MAP (READ THIS BEFORE CALLING)
Objections happen in the same order every call:
Opening / Trust


Existing coverage


Time / delay


SSN / medical verification


Cost / commitment


Match the objection to the stage you’re in.

1. OPENING OBJECTIONS (FIRST 10–20 SECONDS)
“I don’t remember filling anything out.”
 No problem — most people don’t. This is in reference to the policy you already have in force, not a new application.
“I already have insurance.”
 Perfect — that’s actually why I’m calling. This is just a review of your existing coverage.
“I have insurance through my work.”
 That’s very common. Just keep in mind employer coverage usually expires about 30 days after you quit, retire, or are terminated, so this makes sure you’re covered your entire life.
“Is this a sales call?”
 No — this is a policy review, not a new sale.
“How did you get my information?”
 It came directly from the insurance company when your policy was issued.
“What company are you with again?”
 I’m calling from the insurance division that services your policy through your carrier.

2. COVERAGE / VALUE OBJECTIONS
“Why would I get more coverage for the same price?”
 Insurance pricing updates over time, and some policies qualify for adjustments based on underwriting or age.
“That doesn’t make sense.”
 I understand — that’s exactly why the carrier flags policies like this for review.
“Sounds too good to be true.”
 Nothing changes unless the carrier confirms it in writing.
“I don’t want to change my policy.”
 That’s totally fine — nothing changes today. This just checks what you qualify for more coverage or a more managable premium.
“I’m happy with what I have.”
 That’s great — this just confirms you’re not missing anything you already qualify for.

3. TIME / DELAY OBJECTIONS
“I’m busy.”
 I understand — this only takes about two or three minutes.
“Can you call me another day?”
 Absolutely. Today we just want to make sure you get approved so the price doesn’t change. This will take a couple moments, then we can follow up another day.
“I don’t have time for this.”
 That’s why the carrier keeps this very short — they don’t want policies sitting unresolved.

4. TRUST / LEGITIMACY OBJECTIONS
“You guys keep calling me.”
 I know — the reason is there’s a flag on your policy for review. Until it’s resolved, you’re going to keep receiving these calls.
“How do I know this is legit?”
 You can verify my license through the state, and everything we do is confirmed directly by the insurance company.
“I’ve been scammed before.”
 I understand — that’s exactly why nothing is finalized today and everything is verified through the carrier.
“Send me something in the mail.”
 I can, but the carrier won’t release documents until the review is completed. Once it is, they send everything directly to you.
“I don’t do anything over the phone.”
 I understand. For security reasons, the carrier only allows these reviews to be completed verbally, and nothing is finalized today.

5. MEDICAL & SSN OBJECTIONS (MOST IMPORTANT)
“Why do you need medical information?”
 This just allows the carrier to re-check eligibility, the same way they did when the policy was first issued.
“Is this a credit check?”
 No — this has nothing to do with credit. It’s strictly medical and prescription history.
“Why do you need my Social Security number?”
 That’s how the insurance company pulls the correct medical and prescription records.
“I don’t give my SSN over the phone.”
 I completely understand. This is a HIPAA-protected process, and I can read it back to you for verification.
“Is this required?”
 Yes — the carrier requires it to complete the review.
“Can we skip that part?”
 I wish we could, but that’s the only way the carrier can verify eligibility.
“Can I call you back with that?”
 Of course — what time works best today while the file is still open?

6. COST / COMMITMENT OBJECTIONS
“I can’t afford anything else.”
 That’s totally fine — this review does not increase your payment, and will most likely decrease your payment.
“I don’t want my bill to change.”
 Nothing changes without your approval.
“Is this going to cost me money?”
 No — this is strictly a review of your existing policy.

“ I dont want another policy or i dont want to be billed twice"
“You’re not getting an additional policy — this just updates your coverage, and if anything replaces the old one, the carrier cancels it so you’re never billed twice.”

7. CLOSING HESITATION
“I need to think about it.”
 That makes sense. This step just allows the carrier to verify everything — you’ll still have time to review before any decisions.
“I want to talk to my spouse.”
 Of course — we can complete the review now and go over the results together once they’re available, as well will send you a paper policy in the mail so you guys can go over it together and call me if you have any problems”

Multiple calls → “Policy flag”



FINAL COACHING NOTES (DO NOT SKIP)
Slow down — speed kills trust


Silence after rebuttals is powerful


If they’re talking, you’re still in control


Confidence beats perfect wording


Do NOT over-explain
