LEADERSHIP PERFORMANCE & SUCCESSION SYSTEM
Executive Development & Predictable Promotion Roadmap

1. Executive Overview
System Purpose:
The Leadership Performance & Succession System (LPSS) is a mission-critical framework designed to track, evaluate, and develop leadership talent across the organization. It provides real-time visibility into leader effectiveness, promotion readiness, development progress, and mentorship engagement.
Why It Is Critical:
Ensures predictable leadership pipeline and succession coverage.
Minimizes performance gaps that can impact revenue, operations, and culture.
Reduces risk of attrition in key leadership positions.
Enables proactive decision-making on promotions, talent development, and interventions.
Users:
Executives (CEO, COO, C-suite)
Human Resources / Talent teams
Leadership development teams
Department managers
Decisions Enabled:
Promotions and role readiness
Succession planning
Mentorship assignment and effectiveness tracking
Performance remediation or development interventions
Risks Without This System:
Untracked or inconsistent leadership performance
Missed promotion opportunities
Leadership gaps causing operational disruption
Low employee engagement and retention in teams led by underperforming managers

2. System Objectives & KPIs
Core Objectives:
Ensure leadership performance is measurable, comparable, and actionable.
Enable early detection of underperformance.
Track progress on development paths and mentorship.
Create transparent promotion readiness criteria.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Monthly
HR / Mentor
≥ 95% completion
Mentorship Engagement
# of mentoring sessions completed per leader vs. planned
Monthly
Mentor / HR
≥ 100% adherence
Time-to-Promotion
Average duration from readiness identification to promotion

3. Scorecards & Metrics
Scorecard Framework:
Metric Category
Example Metrics
Measurement Frequency
Owner
Weight
Automation / Alerts
Performance
Team growth, revenue contribution, goal achievement
Monthly
Direct Manager
40%
Auto-alert if below threshold
Engagement
Employee satisfaction, 1:1 feedback completion

Scoring Logic:
Weighted sum: Leadership Score = (Performance*0.4) + (Engagement*0.2) + (Development*0.2) + (Strategic Impact*0.2)
Thresholds:
≥85% = On track / ready
70–84% = Needs development
<70% = Immediate intervention required
Alert Logic:
Automated notifications to HR, direct manager, and executive sponsor if score drops below 70%.
Escalation rules trigger leadership review within 48 hours.

4. Promotion Readiness Dashboards
Leadership Levels & Criteria:
Level 1: Manager
Level 2: Senior Manager

Level 4: VP / Executive
Dashboard Views:
Individual leader scorecards with trend lines
Team-level aggregated performance
Department-level succession coverage
Indicators:
Readiness % (score vs threshold)
Gaps in required development milestones
Required actions (training, mentorship, project assignments)
Integration:
Predictive analytics module forecasts promotion readiness based on historical trends, score trajectories, and mentorship progress.
Alerts for stagnating leaders or high-risk underperformance cases.

5. Development Paths & Mentorship Tracking
Development Path Framework:
Standardized per leadership level with milestones for skills, projects, and certifications.
