 * copy (via the `__LIFEOS_VERSION__` Vite-injected global). Mismatch →
 * "Update Available" popup fires.
 *
 * Versioning rules (semver, mirrors Apple's policy):
 *   - MAJOR (X.0.0) — annual flagship; breaking redesign or new lounge
 *   - MINOR (0.X.0) — new feature shipped during the year
 *   - PATCH (0.0.X) — bug fixes / quality improvements / hotfixes
 *
 * Both Gold Coast and Heritage import from `@shared/lifeos` so they always
 * report the same version. Bumping requires editing this file in BOTH the
 * gcf root (Gold Coast) and the heritage-app branch (Heritage) to stay
 * in lockstep.

Best).
- **Quotes too.** Lumico is also selectable on the Quotes page, and policy-quote emails carry the same branded treatment.
- **Client-facing forms match.** The secure form your client lands on uses Lumico's colors, form titles, and security messaging — consistent from inbox to submission.

## Under the Hood

- One new entry in \`CARRIER_EMAIL_BRANDING\` (server) + \`CARRIER_BRANDING\` (shared) covers every surface — colors sampled directly from the official gradient logo (purple #8E4CA8 → magenta #D62373 → orange #F26430 → amber #F5A81C), hosted on our own Firebase storage.`;
