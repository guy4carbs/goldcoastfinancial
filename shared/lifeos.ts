 * what version is running; the client compares against its own baked-in
 * copy (via the `__LIFEOS_VERSION__` Vite-injected global). Mismatch →
 * "Update Available" popup fires.
 *
 * Versioning rules (semver, mirrors Apple's policy):
 *   - MAJOR (X.0.0) — annual flagship; breaking redesign or new lounge
 *   - MINOR (0.X.0) — new feature shipped during the year
 *   - PATCH (0.0.X) — bug fixes / quality improvements / hotfixes
 *
 * Both Gold Coast and Heritage import from `@shared/lifeos` so they always
 * report the same version. Bumping requires editing this file in BOTH the
 * gcf root (Gold Coast) and the heritage-app branch (Heritage) to stay
 * in lockstep.

Fixed: getUserByEmail now compares LOWER(email) on both sides so any casing of the same address resolves to the same user.

export const LIFEOS_RELEASE_BODY_MARKDOWN = `## What's Fixed

- **Case-insensitive email lookup in \`storage.getUserByEmail\`.** Heritage's user lookup did \`eq(users.email, email)\` — a case-sensitive exact match. When a user's email was stored at invite time as \`Khadinmorrow@icloud.com\` (or any mixed case) and they later typed or pasted \`khadinmorrow@icloud.com\` to log in, the lookup returned null, the password check never ran, and they got "Invalid email or password" — even though their password (and a fresh password reset) was perfectly valid. Same email mismatch silently broke the password-reset email send (returned 200 for enumeration safety, never sent). Fix replaces the equality with \`LOWER(\${users.email}) = \${normalized}\` and trims/lowercases the input before comparison. PR #48 (commit 411ac87) shipped this fix to every branch back in May; heritage-app was the only one that never received it.`;
