 * copy (via the `__LIFEOS_VERSION__` Vite-injected global). Mismatch →
 * "Update Available" popup fires.
 *
 * Versioning rules (semver, mirrors Apple's policy):
 *   - MAJOR (X.0.0) — annual flagship; breaking redesign or new lounge
 *   - MINOR (0.X.0) — new feature shipped during the year
 *   - PATCH (0.0.X) — bug fixes / quality improvements / hotfixes
 *
 * Both Gold Coast and Heritage import from `@shared/lifeos` so they always
 * report the same version. Bumping requires editing this file in BOTH the
 * gcf root (Gold Coast) and the heritage-app branch (Heritage) to stay
 * in lockstep.

 * to display. Founders can still author richer notes from the Gold Coast

- **Role tiers live in one place.** New \`client/src/lib/roleTiers.ts\` exports \`FOUNDERS_ONLY\`, \`ADMIN_PLUS\`, \`DIRECTOR_PLUS\`, \`MANAGER_PLUS\`, and \`ALL_AUTHENTICATED\`. Each lounge in the Lobby grid, sidebar, and dropdown switcher references a tier instead of restating the role list inline. Mirrors the gcf server-side pattern so both apps think about access in the same shape.
- **Gold Coast link is strict-founder-only.** The "Gold Coast" external link in every Heritage view (Lobby card, sidebar, dropdown) now only shows for the founder role itself. Matches the gcf Founders Lounge access policy — no point showing the link to someone who'd just bounce off the destination.
- **Admin Lounge is admin-only.** Tighter than before: only \`founder\`, \`owner\`, and \`system_admin\` see the Admin Lounge. The previous role list also included directors and managers; that's gone.
- **Manager and Director Lounges now properly tiered.** Manager Lounge requires the manager tier (founder/owner/system_admin/director/agency_manager/manager). Director Lounge tightens to director tier and above (excludes individual managers).`;
