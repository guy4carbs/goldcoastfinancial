 * Vite-injected global). Mismatch → "Update Available" popup fires.
 *
 * Versioning rules (semver, mirrors Apple's policy):
 *   - MAJOR (X.0.0) — annual flagship; breaking redesign or new lounge
 *   - MINOR (0.X.0) — new feature shipped during the year
 *   - PATCH (0.0.X) — bug fixes / quality improvements / hotfixes
 *
 * Both Gold Coast and Heritage import from `@shared/lifeos` so they always
 * report the same version. Bumping requires editing this file in BOTH the
 * gcf root (Gold Coast) and the heritage-app branch's shared/ (Heritage)
 * to stay in lockstep.

- **Aggressive bucket-name sanitizer.** Previous version only caught a single layer of ASCII quotes. Now strips every leading/trailing character that isn't \`[a-z0-9]\` from the bucket env var — so curly quotes, backticks, brackets, stray whitespace, etc. all get scrubbed before the name goes to GCS.
- **Diagnostic surfaces the sanitized bucket name.** \`/api/hcms/agents/_debug/storage-auth\` now returns \`bucket_name\`, \`bucket_name_length\`, and \`bucket_name_raw_length\`. If raw and sanitized lengths differ, the sanitizer stripped wrapper chars; if they're equal but the name still has weird chars, the env var needs manual fixing.`;
