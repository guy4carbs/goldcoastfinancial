 * client compares against its own baked-in copy (via the `__LIFEOS_VERSION__`
 * Vite-injected global). Mismatch → "Update Available" popup fires.
 *
 * Versioning rules (semver, mirrors Apple's policy):
 *   - MAJOR (X.0.0) — annual flagship; breaking redesign or new lounge
 *   - MINOR (0.X.0) — new feature shipped during the year
 *   - PATCH (0.0.X) — bug fixes / quality improvements / hotfixes
 *
 * Both Gold Coast and Heritage import from `@shared/lifeos` so they always
 * report the same version. Bumping requires editing this file in BOTH the
 * gcf root (Gold Coast) and the heritage-app branch's shared/ (Heritage)
 * to stay in lockstep.

- **Defensive env-var sanitization for storage config.** \`VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET\` and \`VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY\` (plus their non-\`VITE_\` aliases) are now trimmed of whitespace and have a single layer of surrounding double or single quotes stripped before use. Firebase's wrapper used to tolerate quoted bucket names; the canonical GCS endpoint does not, so the same env-var state that "worked" before was suddenly rejected with \`Invalid bucket name\`.
- No operator action needed — the existing quoted env var in Railway is now accepted as-is. Cleaning up the env var to remove the quotes is still a good idea long-term, but no longer urgent.`;
